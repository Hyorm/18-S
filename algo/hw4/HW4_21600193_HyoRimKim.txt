0. How to compile "HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.c" source code into an output file

	1) Command
	$ make

	2) makefile

		hw4: hw4 HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.o
		        gcc -o hw4 HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.o
		        ./hw4 $(filename)
		        rm hw4
		HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.o: HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.c
		        gcc -c HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.c

		clean: 
		        rm HW4_21600193_HyoRimKim.o 

	2) input data
		-dafault file name: hw4.data
		(If you want use another file, use follow command)
		-	$ make filename=[another_filename]

1. Result: The program print followings.

	1) Array of adjacency list of above graph
		I created a linked list array using a structure called a vertex.
	2) Discovery time and finish time of each vertex after step1 
		After that, I used the DFS algorithm to figure out the time of each vertex.(use vertex** adjList)
	3) Array of adjacency list of transpose graph after step2
		After that, I modified the value of the adjacency matrix and created a linked list array with that value.
	4) Discovery time and finish time of each vertex after step3 
		After that, I used the DFS algorithm to figure out the time of each vertex.(use vertex** trsList)
	5) SCC result
		I found the SCC after comparing the time values of each vertex.
